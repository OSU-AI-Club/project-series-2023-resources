## Running Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Assuming you have python installed, "cd" into the directory and run "pip install -r requirements.txt". All required libraries will be installed onto your system.
3. You can now open the notebooks in any editor that supports Jupyter Notebooks, such as Visual Studio Code. If you have multiple pip/conda environments, make sure you select the kernel with the packages installed.
